Only 5% of patients will require ICU care including breathing support or medications to support their blood pressure.": "",

  "Information from Community Isolation Facility, Expo\nTranslation by Mdm Shima": "",
  "1. What is mental well-being?  ": "",
  "Mental wellbeing is an integral part of our overall health. It is how we respond to life's ups and downs.  It is important to understand that mental wellbeing is not the absence of mental illness or the lack of problems, challenges, and adversity. \nYou can have mental wellness even when if you are having an illness or going through a hard time in life, such as the current COVID19 pandemic.": "",
  "2. I'm not sick, but many friends and I feel down and stressed. Why?": "",
  "COVID19 is has affected people directly and indirectly all over the world physically, emotionally, financially and socially. Even if you are not infected with COVID19, it is normal to feel stressed, anxious or down. We read and hear news about the impact of COVID many times each day. After some time, our emotions and mood start to get affected. Our lives are also changed in many ways. We are not able to move about as freely as we used to. We are also not able to interact with our family and friends like how we used to. We may be worried about our health, our jobs, our family's welfare. All these changes add a tremendous amount of stress to our lives.": "",
  "3. What can I do to make things better?": "",
  "Seek accurate information from reliable sources and do not believe and spread everything we read or hear. Limit the number of times we actively search out news about the disease to just once or twice a day. Keep ourselves healthy by practicing good hygiene. Keep others healthy by practising social distancing. Seek medical attention early even if we feel mildly sick and cooperate with the authorities. Continue to communicate regularly with family and friends through non-face-to-face means. Help look out for others that you know.": "",
  "4. It's difficult to sleep at night. What can I do?": "",
  "During this time, our sleep may be affected because we may be worried about many things.  Try to avoid discussing troubling things just before sleeping time.  Also practice deep breathing exercises and focusing on positive thoughts may help relax.  Do not try to use alcohol to help with your sleep as it will lead to other problems and cutting down on smoking and coffee/tea particularly in the afternoon would help.  ": "",
  "5. I'm constantly worried about catching COVID-19. What can I do? ": "",
  "Remember that you are not alone in this.  People would naturally be worried that they may get infected.  Remember that infection can be prevented by simple measures of washing hands frequently, coughing or sneezing into tissue paper, wearing a mask when unwell, and keeping a safe distance from others. Remember also, that COVID19 is a mild disease for most people who get infected. Keep yourself meaningfully occupied with a daily routine and by maintaining regular communication with your friends and family.": "",
  "6. I feel frustrated and helpless to be indoors all the time. What can I do?": "",
  "Try to have a schedule of the routine that will fill the hours of the day.  You can do simple exercises even when you are indoors.  Stretching and other exercises have been shown to improve our mood states.  Try to do fun things like playing board games, mobile games, watching TV/movies or listening to music.  You can also connect with your friends and family through social media.  Focus on the good aspect of things and remind yourselves that this is temporary and it will eventually pass and things will be normal again. ": ""
