  "1. What is COVID-19? ": "",
  "COVID-19 (more specifically, a coronavirus) is the disease identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China": "",
  "2. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?": "",
  "The most common symptoms are fever, tiredness and dry cough. Some patients also have runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.\nSome people become infected but remain asymptomatic.\nIt can however, also cause lung infection, or pneumonia.": "",
  "3. How does COVID-19 spread?": "",
  "People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The virus spreads via respiratory droplets (sharing saliva, utensils, being in close contact or through direct contact with droplets on surfaces and materials).": "",
  "4. What is the test for COVID-19 like?": "",
  "It is a swab test inserted in your nostril or at the back of your throat. It will last about 10 seconds. There might be a slight discomfort, however it is not significantly painful.": "",
  "5. What happens if I am tested positive for COVID-19?": "",
  "Arrangements will be made for you to be warded or sent to a community isolation facility, to be placed under observation. You will be observed for deterioration. You might require X-Rays and blood tests as well. Repeated testing of your respiratory samples (via nose or throat) will be done on a regular basis, usually 24 hours apart. If you test negative twice consecutively, you can be discharged back to your home/dorm to continue 2 weeks of isolation at home.": "",
  "6. Will I die from COVID-19?": "",
  "It is normal to worry about how COVID-19 might affect you or your loved ones. In 80% of cases, infections from COVID-19 are usually mild and do not even need any treatment. There is a chance of deterioration due to the virus, which happens more commonly in the elderly population or in those with significant pre-existing medical conditions. Only 5% of patients will require ICU care including breathing support or medications to support their blood pressure.": "",
  "7. Is there a treatment for COVID-19?": "",
  "Most cases of COVID-19 infections do not require any treatment, and only require medications to alleviate symptoms. There is currently no established treatment for the 5% of patients with severe disease, however there are many clinical trials ongoing which have shown variable success. Even though there is no established treatment, if you do develop severe disease, you will still receive breathing support and will be given medications to support your blood pressure.": "",
  "8. How much do I have to pay for my treatment?": "",
  "As of Singapore Government's announcement on 7 March 2020, if you are a Singapore Citizen, Singapore resident OR a long term pass holder, your hospital bill will be covered by the Government. This does not apply if you have left Singapore after 27 March 2020 and you are admitted as a suspected COVID-19 case within 14 days of returning.": "",
  "9. I am worried about missing so much work. Will my boss fire me?": "",
  "Your employer is legally mandated to allow your quarantine/treatment. Your employer is also legally bound to continue to pay your salaries even if you are not allowed to leave your dormitory during this Circuit Breaker period. If your employer does not pay your salary within 7 days of the end of the salary period, he can be prosecuted by the Singapore Government.": "",
  "10. I am scared and I want to go home.": "",
  "It is natural to be scared and anxious during this period. For the safety of your family, it is imperative that you follow the instructions given to you by your doctors and the Government.

Singapore has good hospitals and treatment here and will endeavour to give you the best medical care possible.": "",
  "11. How can I make sure I do not get infected with COVID-19?": "",
  "Fortunately, there are some preventive measures you can take to minimise the risk of infection. They are:\n1. Thoroughly washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\n2. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.\n3. Covering your mouth and nose with your elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.\n4. Maintaining at least 1 metre distance between yourself and anyone else.\n5. Staying indoors if you feel unwell and keep isolated from others.

  "Information from Community Isolation Facility, Expo\nTranslation by Mdm Shima": "",
  "1. What is mental well-being?  ": "",
  "Mental wellbeing is an integral part of our overall health. It is how we respond to life's ups and downs.  It is important to understand that mental wellbeing is not the absence of mental illness or the lack of problems, challenges, and adversity. \nYou can have mental wellness even when if you are having an illness or going through a hard time in life, such as the current COVID19 pandemic.": "",
  "2. I'm not sick, but many friends and I feel down and stressed. Why?": "",
  "COVID19 is has affected people directly and indirectly all over the world physically, emotionally, financially and socially. Even if you are not infected with COVID19, it is normal to feel stressed, anxious or down. We read and hear news about the impact of COVID many times each day. After some time, our emotions and mood start to get affected. Our lives are also changed in many ways. We are not able to move about as freely as we used to. We are also not able to interact with our family and friends like how we used to. We may be worried about our health, our jobs, our family's welfare. All these changes add a tremendous amount of stress to our lives.": "",
  "3. What can I do to make things better?": "",
  "Seek accurate information from reliable sources and do not believe and spread everything we read or hear. Limit the number of times we actively search out news about the disease to just once or twice a day. Keep ourselves healthy by practicing good hygiene. Keep others healthy by practising social distancing. Seek medical attention early even if we feel mildly sick and cooperate with the authorities. Continue to communicate regularly with family and friends through non-face-to-face means. Help look out for others that you know.": "",
  "4. It's difficult to sleep at night. What can I do?": "",
  "During this time, our sleep may be affected because we may be worried about many things.  Try to avoid discussing troubling things just before sleeping time.  Also practice deep breathing exercises and focusing on positive thoughts may help relax.  Do not try to use alcohol to help with your sleep as it will lead to other problems and cutting down on smoking and coffee/tea particularly in the afternoon would help.  ": "",
  "5. I'm constantly worried about catching COVID-19. What can I do? ": "",
  "Remember that you are not alone in this.  People would naturally be worried that they may get infected.  Remember that infection can be prevented by simple measures of washing hands frequently, coughing or sneezing into tissue paper, wearing a mask when unwell, and keeping a safe distance from others. Remember also, that COVID19 is a mild disease for most people who get infected. Keep yourself meaningfully occupied with a daily routine and by maintaining regular communication with your friends and family.": "",
  "6. I feel frustrated and helpless to be indoors all the time. What can I do?": "",
  "Try to have a schedule of the routine that will fill the hours of the day.  You can do simple exercises even when you are indoors.  Stretching and other exercises have been shown to improve our mood states.  Try to do fun things like playing board games, mobile games, watching TV/movies or listening to music.  You can also connect with your friends and family through social media.  Focus on the good aspect of things and remind yourselves that this is temporary and it will eventually pass and things will be normal again. ": ""
