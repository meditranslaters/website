  "3. How does COVID-19 spread?": "",

  "4. What is the test for COVID-19 like?": "",

Only 5% of patients will require ICU care including breathing support or medications to support their blood pressure.": "",
  "7. Is there a treatment for COVID-19?": "",
  "Most cases of COVID-19 infections do not require any treatment, and only require medications to alleviate symptoms.

All these changes add a tremendous amount of stress to our lives.": "",
